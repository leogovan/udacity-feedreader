# frontend-nanodegree-feedreader-project

## Description

This is my project for the Udacity Frontend Nanodegree: Feedreader Testing.

The project brief is to take a news feed reading application and, using the Jasmine JS testing framework, write the pre-defined tests. The object is to learn about applying the test-driven development approach to this project and my future work.

### Instructions

To run this, download/clone from [github.com](https://github.com/leogovan/udacity-feedreader) and click on index.html. The tests were written to jasmine/spec/feedreader.js

### Further reading

The project starter code provided by Udacity is using an older version of [Jasmine: 2.1.2](https://jasmine.github.io/2.1/introduction). Check out the documentation for this in the link provided.
